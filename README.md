# Data structures in C

I'm incredibly bored, so I'll try to implement the following data structures in C:

0. [ ] Stack
1. [ ] Queue
2. [ ] Heap (Priority queue)
3. [ ] HashMap / HashSet
4. [ ] Trie
5. [ ] Segment Tree
6. [ ] Lazy Segment Tree
7. [ ] (maybe never) Red-Black tree

The structure of each directory is supposed to look like this:
```
structure 
|__ src/
    |__ structure.h
|__ tests/
    |__ test_structure.c
|__ Makefile
```
```
```
